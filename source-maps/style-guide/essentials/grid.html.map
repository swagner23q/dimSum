The implementation here is using <a href=\"http://jeet.gs/\" target=\"_blank\">Jeet</a>, a grid system for human. Jeet is available anywhere in stylus and here are some examples of the things you can do with Jeet.\n\n    .example.clearfix\n      .col-one-third\n        .feature.gfx-top.white\n          .wrapper\n            .gfx\n              img(src='/gfx/vectors/software-development.svg')\n            .description\n              h2.title\n                | Flexibility\n              p Jeet is built on CSS preprocessors. As such, you're no longer limited to classes like <code>.col-6</code>. Instead, you can pass any fraction, decimal, or combination of the two, to create a completely custom grid.\n\n      .col-one-third\n        .feature.gfx-top.white\n          .wrapper\n            .gfx\n              img(src='/gfx/vectors/international-exports.svg')\n            .description\n              h2.title\n                | Helper Classes\n              p Jeet has been extended here to include helper classes that can be added to DOM elements. Elements can be given a fixed column width and cycle by using the following classes: <code>.col-one-half</code>, <code>.col-one-third</code>, <code>.col-one-fourth</code>, <code>.col-one-fifth</code>, etc. onto 12 columns.\n\n      .col-one-third\n        .feature.gfx-top.white\n          .wrapper\n            .gfx\n              img(src='/gfx/vectors/ecommerce-fulfillment.svg')\n            .description\n              h2.title\n                | Stylus Mixins\n              p Be sure to use Jeet's mixins in elements when you can. <code>col(ratios: 1, offset: 0, cycle: 0, uncycle: 0, gutter: jeet-gutter)</code>. Again, this mixin is available anywhere you can write stylus.\n\n      .example.clearfix\n        .col-one-half\n          .feature.gfx-top.white\n            .wrapper\n              .gfx\n                img(src='/gfx/vectors/website-hosting-management.svg')\n              .description\n                h2.title\n                  | Tips\n                p It's a good idea to wrap your columns in an element that is self cleared. This is accomplished by adding a DOM element with the class of <code>.clearfix</code> around your columns or extending the <code>clearfix()</code> mixin directly on your element containing the columns.\n\n        .col-one-half\n          .feature.gfx-bottom.white\n            .wrapper\n              .description\n                h2.title\n                  | More Documentation\n                p Be sure to read the <a href=\"http://jeet.gs/\" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a> about Jeet to learn more about this grid system.\n              .gfx\n                img(src='/gfx/vectors/international-exports.svg')\n"],"file":"style-guide/essentials/grid.html","sourceRoot":"/source/"}
