They are typically used as a heading for a service page or as a full-width section on another page. Here are some examples of how features can be organized.\n\n  .example\n    section.feature.gfx-left.white\n      .wrapper\n        .gfx\n          img(src='/gfx/vectors/ecommerce-fulfillment.svg')\n        .description\n          h2.title\n            | Sample Feature<br><code>.gfx-left</code>\n          p This feature shows the graphic to the left and the title on the right. This is one of four ways a feature can be displayed. The position of the graphic and the title are determined by their order in the DOM as well as a class applied to the element.\n\n    section.feature.gfx-right.blue.lighten-5\n      .wrapper\n        .description\n          h2.title\n            i.fa.fa-github-alt\n            | Sample Feature<br><code>.gfx-right</code>\n          p Features can always have icons in their title by adding an <code>&#60;i&#62;</code> element inside the <code>.title</code> heading. Also, adding an <code>.odd</code> or <code>.even</code> class to a feature gives it an accent background which is useful for displaying multiple features in a row.\n        .gfx\n          img(src='/gfx/vectors/website-hosting-management.svg')\n\n    section.feature.gfx-top.white\n      .wrapper\n        .gfx\n          img(src='/gfx/vectors/software-development.svg')\n        .description\n          h2.title\n            | Sample Feature <code>.gfx-top</code>\n          p This feature shows the graphic above and the description below. This is one of four ways a feature can be displayed. With <code>.gfx-top</code> and <code>.gfx-bottom</code> the graphic is styled to be 50% the width of its parent and have auto margins left and right.\n\n    section.feature.gfx-bottom.blue.lighten-5\n      .wrapper\n        .description\n          h2.title\n            | Sample Feature <code>.gfx-bottom</code>\n          p This feature shows the graphic below and the description above. The children of feature elements should always be wrapped in a <code>.wrapper</code> element for spacing and alignment.\n        .gfx\n          img(src='/gfx/vectors/international-exports.svg')\n"],"file":"style-guide/components/features.html","sourceRoot":"/source/"}
