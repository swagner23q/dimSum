Page sections can contain a multitude of other elements, but they mainly style these three types of children elements:\n    ul\n      li <code>&#60;h2&#62;</code>\n      li <code>&#60;h3&#62;</code>\n      li <code>&#60;p&#62;</code>\n\n  .example\n    section.page-section.white\n      h2 Example 1\n      h3 Page section with a subtitle. Notice the element above contains an underscore.\n      p This text here would be some description text that supplements the heading and subtitle. Typically you'll place a paragraph here and have three balanced sentences. Be sure to check out the different variants of page sections below.\n\n  .example\n    section.page-section.red.lighten-5\n      h2 Example 2\n      p To add a background color to a page section, simply add a color class defined in the available color palette to the element. Also, any of these children elements for page sections are optional. Notice how this page section doesn't contain a subtitle.\n\n  .example\n    section.page-section.white\n      h2 Example 3\n      p This is a page section that also contains a feature. Page sections are great because they can contain any number of elements.\n      .feature.gfx-top\n        .wrapper\n          .gfx\n            img(src='/gfx/vectors/software-development.svg')\n          .description\n            h2.title\n              | Sample Feature <code>.gfx-top</code>\n            p This feature shows the graphic above and the description below. This is one of four ways a feature can be displayed.
